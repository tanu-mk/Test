                                                   Test - 2
1 Q) Explain JRE, JVM,JDK
           
			JDK 
		- Jdk means java development kit
		-which contains jre and development tools(i.e compiler, )
		-which helps the java to develop a software 
		
			JRE
		-Jre means java runtime environment
		-which contains jvm and set of libraries
		-which helps the java to run the code

			JVM
		-Jvm means java virtual machine
		-provide runtime environment to execute the byte code
		-tasks of jvm
		* to load the bytecode
		* to verify the bytecode
		* to execute the bytecode
		-which helps to convert bytecode to machine code and displays on various platforms. 
		
2 Q) What is an Array

		-Array is a collection of groups of statements of similar datatypes
		
		Syntax :Datatype variableName[] = {data/values};
		
		    ex :String hotelNames[] = {"Taj Vivantha", "Ashoka Hotel", "Halli Mane"}; 
		
		-There are two types of array
		*Explicit 
		*Implicit
		
3 Q) Explain the following 
   1- class, objects, static, public, private keywords
   2- public static void main(String args[])
   3- System.out.println()
 
1- 
 class - It is a design or a blueprint which contains states and behaviour where states represents variables
			and behaviour represents methods.
		-Members of class are methods, variables and constructor
		
 objects - Its an instance of a class
		 - Syntax : className ref = new className();
		
 static - variables which are declared inside class outside method with the keyword static
			ex : static String str = {""};
			
 public - It is a keyword
		- It is access modifier
		
 private - It is a keyword
		 - It is access modifier
		
2-

public static void main(String args[])

public - access modifier
static - access modifier
void - return type which returns the values
main - method
(String args[]) - argument line without this we cannot run the java program

3-

System.out.println()

4 Q) Explain datatypes in java and give example for each

	Represents different values to be stored in a variable

	There are two types of dataTypes
	*Primitive datatypes
	*Non Primitive datatypes
	
	Primitive Datatypes : bit, byte, short, char, int, float, double, boolean
	
	Non Primitive DataTypes : String, ClassName, System etc
	
5 Q) What is variable expain its types

	Variables are registered area allocated in a memeory
	types- Local, instance, static and parameter
	
	Local - variable which is declared inside the method 
	instance - variable which is declared inside class and outside method without the keyword static
	static - variable which is declared inside class and outside method with the keyword static
	
	
	
13 Q) class Factorial{

	public static void main(String a[]){
	
		int num = 10;
		long factorial = 1;
		
			for(int z=1; z<=num; z++)
			{
				factorial = factorial * z;
			}
	System.out.printf("Factorial of %d = %d" , num , factorial);	
	
	
	}
}

9 Q) What gives java its 'write once and run anywhere' nature
		Bceause it is Platform Independent
		
8 Q) Explain java features
	
	*Simple
	*Object Oriented
	*Platform Independent
	*Secured
	*Robust
	*portable
	*High Performane
	*Dynamic
	*Multi-threaded
	*Distributed
	*Arcitectural Neutral
	
7 Q)
		-Constuctor is a special type of method which is same name as class name with no return type.
		- Constructor is invoked when object is created
		- yes, class contains a multiple constructors
		- There are two types of constructors
			*default constructor - java compiler provides default constructor
			*Parameterized constructor - inside a constructor arguments are passed
		
12 Q)

class ReverseOfNumber{

	public static void main(String t[]){
	
	int number = -1234;
	int reverseNumber = 0;
	
	while(number!=0)
	{
		int rem = number%10;
		reverseNumber = reverseNumber*10+rem;
	}
	
	System.out.println("The reverse number is: " + reverseNumber);
 }
}
